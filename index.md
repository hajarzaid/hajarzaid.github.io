Hello, my name is Hajar Zaid. I am a Master's student at CUNY Graduate Center studying Data Science within the Computer Science department. I received my Bachelor's from Queens College in Mathematics with a concentration in Pure Mathematics. My research interests lie at the intersection of deep learning, optimization, and theoretical neuroscience. My goal is to explore, experience, and experiment with divergent ideas that broaden my perspective on research questions and their applications.

I am driven by the fact that many mathematical theories reappear across disciplines, often disguised under different names and that advancements do not always emerge within a single discipline. These theories are highly studied and well understood within mathematics, yet their applications in other fields are not always recognized (see [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/wigner.pdf). The job of a mathematician is to abstract and uncover these underlying structures, revealing deep connections between seemingly unrelated areas. The problem is that mathematicians have studied structures and concepts in isolation from their applications, but I believe bridging this gap is essential for meaningful progress.

Here are just a few reasons why you should care:

1. Recognizing fundamental mathematical structures across disciplines provides a more profound comprehension of complex systems. 
2. Abstracting problems mathematically allows solutions to apply across different domains, reducing redundancy in problem-solving.
3. Using well-established mathematical frameworks leads to more robust, interpretable, and theoretically grounded models.
4. Theoreticaly grounded models lead to better extrapolation and reasoning beyond observed data.
