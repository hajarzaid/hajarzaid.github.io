## Teaching
The following lists my involvement  in teaching:

-Baruch College, Math Lecturer  (Fall 2024, Spring 2025)

-Queensborough CC, Math Lecturer (Spring 2025)

-Hunter College, Math Tutor (Spring 2024, Fall 2024, Spring 2025)

Iâ€™m also involved in the CUNY Directed Reading Program (DRP), a program which was first established in 1998 at the University of Chicago. It was created by graduate students in the math department as a way to mentor undergraduates through independent reading projects. Since then, the DRP model has spread to universities across the country, particularly in mathematics and theoretical sciences, providing valuable opportunities for students to engage with advanced material outside the classroom. 

Currently, I am mentoring two undergraduates in Numerical Linear Algebra, Low-Rank Approximations, and Perturbation Theory, with a focus on understanding and analyzing the stability of algorithms.
