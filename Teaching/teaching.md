## Teaching
I have taught mathematics across multiple campuses within the CUNY system:

**Baruch College** – Mathematics Lecturer (Fall 2024, Spring 2025, Fall 2025)

**Queensborough Community College** – Mathematics Lecturer (Spring 2025, Fall 2025)

**Hunter College** – Mathematics Tutor (Spring 2024, Fall 2024, Spring 2025, Fall 2025)

In addition to teaching, I am an organizer and graduate mentor for the CUNY Directed Reading Program (DRP), a nationwide initiative originally founded at the University of Chicago to support independent reading projects between undergraduates and graduate students in mathematics and related fields.


**SPRING 2025**: [Exploring Ill-Conditioned Problems & Low-Rank Approximations: A Geometric Perspective on Stability & Efficiency](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1heSgPaRobFUTDdntfMF2OwMprhAj9nSI/view) with Angelo Vitalino and Jeremy Paulino
