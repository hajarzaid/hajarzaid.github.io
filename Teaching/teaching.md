## Teaching
I have taught mathematics across multiple campuses within the CUNY system:

**Baruch College** – Mathematics Lecturer (Fall 2024, Spring 2025)

**Queensborough Community College** – Mathematics Lecturer (Spring 2025)

**Hunter College** – Mathematics Tutor (Spring 2024, Fall 2024, Spring 2025)

In addition to teaching, I am an organizer and graduate mentor for the CUNY Directed Reading Program (DRP), a nationwide initiative originally founded at the University of Chicago to support independent reading projects between undergraduates and graduate students in mathematics and related fields.

As part of the program, I am currently mentoring two undergraduates in numerical linear algebra, focusing on low-rank approximations, perturbation theory, and the stability of numerical algorithms—balancing both theoretical understanding and practical applications.
