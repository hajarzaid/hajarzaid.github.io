### Icahn School of Medicine, Friedman Brain Institute  
**Student Researcher** | *July 2024 - Present*  
Exploring memory representational drift in the olfactory system using random matrix theory, concentration of measure, and optimization techniques under Dr. Evan Schaffer. Developed theoretical models to simulate neural dynamics and the evolution of memory representations over time. Applied advanced mathematical and statistical methods to analyze high-dimensional systems, aiming to deepen the understanding of sensory processing, memory consolidation, and neural plasticity, with potential applications in both neuroscience and AI.

### New York University, Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences  
**Student Researcher** | *May 2024 - Jan 2025*  
Conducted research on Krylov subspace methods and their application to machine learning regularization under Dr. Tyler Chen. Optimized the Conjugate Gradient method with randomized algorithms and preconditioning techniques. Implemented the Nystr√∂m method in Python, evaluating accuracy, speed, and scalability across models to improve solutions for large-scale machine learning problems in high-dimensional settings.
