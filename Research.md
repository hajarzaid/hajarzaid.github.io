### Icahn School of Medicine, Friedman Brain Institute  
**Student Researcher** | *July 2024 - Present*  
Researching random matrix theory, concentration of measure, and optimization techniques to model memory representational drift in the olfactory system. Developed Python models to study neural dynamics and memory evolution, applying statistical methods to analyze complex data. Aiming to enhance understanding of sensory processing, memory consolidation, and neural plasticity with applications in neuroscience and AI.

### New York University, Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences  
**Student Researcher** | *May 2024 - Jan 2025*  
Conducted research on Krylov subspace methods and their application to machine learning regularization under Dr. Tyler Chen. Optimized the Conjugate Gradient method with randomized algorithms and preconditioning techniques. Implemented the Nystr√∂m method in Python, evaluating accuracy, speed, and scalability across models to improve solutions for large-scale machine learning problems in high-dimensional settings.
